                        out tons of viral
                        recipes that get
                        obscenely popular, some of them
                        because they combine simplicity and flavor, others for their absurdity. But the most interesting

                        take a cool idea, a super easy technique, and offer endless options for variation, because that

                        the app really shows off what it does best: let millions of people showcase their own spin on an
                        idea.
                        The latest viral recipe to emerge, called #CustardToast or #YogurtToast, makes it easy to
                        customize a
                        piece of toast into a rich, sweet meal. The former hashtag has 3.3 million views and the latter
                        13.8
                        million views, with an incredible number of the videos going up just in the past few
                        days—meaning we're
                        dealing with feta-pasta or dalgona-coffee speeds of virality.

                One of the original videos to show the technique, from user Moody Day, calls it “An easy cheesecake
                copycat”, summarizing the appeal of the dessert-like breakfast or snack. The catchy recipe starts with
                basic ingredients most folks have on hand, meaning they can make it as soon as the video inspires them:
                two slices of bread, a few spoonfuls of yogurt, one egg, a dollop of honey, and the fruit of your
                choice. Then you use a fork to flatten a little pool in the center of each slice of bread and stir
                together the wet ingredients. Fill the flat part of the bread with the mix, top it with the fruit, and
                slip it into an air fryer for about 10 minutes, or a 400°F oven for a bit longer, until the bread is
                crisp and the custard set.

            <p class="lead myBlogContent mt-5">If you grew up playing The Sims like I did, then you know exactly what
                lobster thermidor is. Or at least, you know what it is in the context of the popular RPG (role playing
                game): It's the final meal your simulated character learns after studying the culinary arts over the
                course of a few days. As in real life, in The Sims, the more you cook and the more cookbooks you read,
                the more recipes you learn, and the faster your simulated character can graduate from salad to spaghetti
                to tri-tip steak, then finally to lobster thermidor.</p>

                So how does this relate to perfectly cooked lobster? Lobster thermidor is, for one, a dish I’d like to
                eat every single day. It also calls for lobster tail meat, which must be cooked properly in order to
                enjoy the succulent, sweet flavor of lobster and maintain its juicy texture, wihtout chewiness. If you
                bear with me for a few more minutes while I spread the love for lobster thermidor, I’ll then get into
                how to thaw frozen lobster tails (which are much more accessible if you don’t live in Maine and want to
                indulge in the crustacean year-round) and how to cook lobster tails.

                In order to satisfy my curiosity and save you time and money, I tested four of the best ways to cook
                lobster tails, including steamed, broiled, boiled, and grilled. But first, back to lobster thermidor.

        <div class="container">
            <p class="lead myBlogContent mt-5">Peeling the perfect hard boiled egg starts with cooking eggs, of
                course. Cook your eggs however you like—in a pot of boiling water with a splash of vinegar, a
                squeeze of lemon juice, a teaspoon of baking soda, or a pinch of salt. All of these additions help
                make it easier to peel boiled eggs. Slightly older eggs will make it easier to peel, but using them
                is not necessary. After all, we have to work with what we have. Another pro tip? Start with water
                that’s already boiling. I know it seems treacherous, but it will make it much easier to peel
                hard-boiled eggs. “I have noticed the egg white sticks to the shell when I start from cold [water],"
                says Jason Hua, executive chef at The Dutch. J. Kenji López-Alt explains this phenomenon on Serious
                Eats: "Slow-cooked egg whites bond more strongly with the membrane on the inside of an eggshell."
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="container">
            <p class="lead myBlogContent mt-5">
                Once the eggs are fully cooked (set a time for 10 to 12 minutes), the next step is to cool the eggs
                down in an ice bath or a bowl of very chilly water, where they should stay for a full five minutes or
                so. Set a timer. Do not disturb. I know you’re hungry and anxious, but the eggs will be better off if
                you just leave them alone.

                Once they are cool enough to handle, fill another clean bowl with room temperature water, and
                submerge the eggs, one at a time. Using the edge of the bowl to knock them, you can now start
                cracking the shell. Do this gently, so as to not break the freshly boiled egg entirely in half.

                Once cracked, the water helps to gently separate both the membrane—that attaches itself with a
                vice-like grip to the egg—and the shell from the egg white, making it so much easier to peel.

                From here, discard the eggshells or, better yet, compost them—they’ll turn into fantastic fertilizer.
                Then slice the boiled eggs and add a sprinkle of flaky salt for a sneaky snack, dice them for potato
                salad, or slice them for a Niçoise salad.

                Presto! The world's shiniest, smoothest, pearliest eggs to impress your friends with. Just don't
                forget to pass on the tip to the next generation.

        <div class="container">
            <p class="lead myBlogContent mt-5">Marjoram is like a thumb. (Stay with me here.) Earlier this week, I
                gave my daughter a preschool level anatomy lesson and explained the names we have for different
                fingers: thumb, pointer finger, and so on. Then I got cocky and added: “You have one thumb on each
                hand, and thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs.”<br>
                My daughter got a little lost, but because you're not three-and-a-half-years-old, you might already
                know where I’m going: Marjoram (Origanum majorana) used to belong to its own genus, but now it
                belongs to the same genus as oregano (Origanum vulgare). This means that all marjoram is now a type
                of oregano, but just as all fingers are not thumbs, all oregano is not marjoram. It’s an herb that
                you can find year-round but is mainly in season during the summer, fall, and winter months. It’s
                known for its sweet, spicy flavor that is mild compared to oregano. But marjoram is its own herb,
                damn it, and we are finally giving it the spotlight that it deserves. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="container">
            <p class="lead myBlogContent mt-5">
                Marjoram looks similar to oregano, which is perhaps not surprising since they are so closely
                related, but there are differences in flavor. As Deborah Madison explains: “Marjoram’s flavor lacks
                the oiliness and abrasiveness of oregano. Marjoram is more delicate and floral than oregano. It is
                sometimes called 'sweet marjoram' and for good reason.” Even if you think you're not familiar with
                marjoram's flavor, you’ve likely had it in its dried form. Dried marjoram often shows up in herb
                blends like za’atar and herbs de Provence.

                By comparison, oregano is in season from late fall through early spring and has a more pronounced
                flavor than marjoram. Italian oregano is milder than Greek oregano, which brings even more of a kick
                to pizza sauce, grilled pork or chicken, fish, and egg dishes.

        <div class="container">
            <p class="lead myBlogContent mt-5">Matbucha likely originated in the cuisines of the Maghreb region in
                North Africa, which includes countries like Egypt and Tunisia, but it’s most strongly associated
                with Moroccan cuisine. Matbucha means “cooked” in Arabic, and it is made by slowly cooking down
                fragrant roasted garlic, juicy tomatoes, oil, and sweet and/or hot peppers with a selection of North
                African spices that change from cook to cook—cumin, paprika, and turmeric are all likely to make an
                appearance. Its flavor is a balanced union of acidity, heat, saltiness, and sweetness. In Israel,
                where many Moroccan Jews have roots, matbucha is a common picnic and breakfast accompaniment to
                cooked meals, sandwiches, and barbecue, beloved by myriad ethnicities within the country. It’s also
                a frequent member of the salatim, or salads, in a meze spread you’d find at a Mediterranean
                restaurant. Its popularity in Israel is perhaps best showcased by the fact that it’s manufactured by
                a number of local brands and sold at grocery stores. In the U.S., it’s been primarily a home-cooked
                indulgence—until now. </p>

                While different matbucha products by Israeli brands and American kosher manufacturers can be found
                online at U.S.-based kosher supermarkets, in 2021, a few U.S.-based independent brands started
                experimenting with selling premade “boutique” matbucha. Curiously enough, it’s matbucha’s second
                spin on the U.S. market: It was once manufactured by larger condiment brands Sabra and Pikante, but
                both have ceased production of matbucha.
